title: Upgraded from project.json to csproj for SimplCommerce
---

Today, we have upgraded from project.json to csproj for [SimplCommerce](https://github.com/simplcommerce/SimplCommerce). It's simple than what I have thought. In this blog post I will share you this journey.

While working with ASP.NET Core in SimplCommerce, I felt in love with project.json. It's an innovation, modern and simple. However, to make the tooling compatible with other .NET app models (WinForms, WPF, UWP, ASP.NET, iOS, Android, etc.), Microsoft have decided to move .NET Core projects to .csproj/MSBuild. More detail about this can be found [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/23/changes-to-project-json/).

Suggling for a while, we finally decided to say goodbye to project.json.

Microsoft doesn't support .NET Core csproj for VS 2015. So, to work with csproj, we need to install VS 2017 RC or go with command line. I choosen to install VS 2017 RC. I use the lasted version of  VS 2017 RC which included .NET Core 1.0 SDK â€“ RC4.

After installed VS 2017 RC. I opened the SimplCommerce.sln. VS show a dialog and ask for an upgrade. Note it's an one way upgrade. Once upgraded, you cannot go back and it cannot open in VS 2015 also.

Took a deep breath and click OK. Whoo! sucessful, the migration report show no error, there was a warning on the solution file but it not important. All the projects loaded. Wait "Error occurred while restoring NuGet packages: The operation failed as details for project SimplCommerce.WebHost could not be loaded." appeared in the Output panel. None of the project can build. Because all the dependencies could not be loaded. Right click on the solution and then "Restore Nuget Package" don't work the same error appear. Tried to workaroud by VS, no luck.

Went to command line and type "dotnet restore" wow, 

"C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\1.0.0-rc4-004771\NuGet.targets(97,5): error : '1.1.0-preview4-final;1.0.0-msbuild3-final' is not a valid version string. [D:\Projects\SimplCommerce\SimplCommerce.sln]"

Let find this string. It is in the SimplCommerce.WebHost.csproj 
`<DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet" Version="1.1.0-preview4-final;1.0.0-msbuild3-final" />`
seem not correct, let remove the "1.1.0-preview4-final;"

All the projects build sucessful. Control + F5 the application run just fine.

Let take a look at what have changed.

 - all the file project.json, project.lock.json, *.xproj was removed. The global.json is removed also.
 - The SimplCommerce.sln just change a little but and seem not important
 - The *csproj look simple and nice
 
So [SimplCommerce](https://github.com/simplcommerce/SimplCommerce) has been upgraded to use csproj. There are a couple of things I want to note here:

 - AppVeyor hasn't offically support .NET Core csproj. But you can request to join their beta [here](https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/1179)
 - Travis hasn't support also. I have submited the request [https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7301](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7301)
